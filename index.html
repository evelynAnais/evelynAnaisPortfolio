          <h3 class="section-names">About</h3>
          <p>I started college not knowing what I wanted to do, I received two associates degrees; one in Early Childhood Education and another in General Studies and while I enjoyed teaching children I was still going to school trying to figure out what I wanted to do "when I grew up."</p>
          <p>Trying a variety of things through out my life I have had two constants. Making jewelry and technology. I have enjoyed making basic html websites since I was 15. I am also the person that looks foward to big updates on software and will go through all the settings of a new device.</p>
          <p>I suppose being persistent has led me on a path that I enjoy. I currently design and collaborate with artists making jewelry and am now attending thinkful to further my skills as a software engineer.</p>
          <p>Welcoming a career as a software engineer I hope to countinue meeting and collaboratong with new people!</p>
